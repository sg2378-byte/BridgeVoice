# BridgeVoice Mobile (Expo)
# BUILT AT GREYHACKS - Rutgers Hackathon
Group members: Sahasra B., Purvi B., Harini T., Sanjana G.
We all worked on two computers for VS Code because we were having trouble getting access to commit, push and pull so most of the commits were made by Purvi or Sahasra. 
This is a fully functional mobile client for BridgeVoice.

## 1) Configure backend URLs for your phone

Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set your machine LAN IP (not localhost):

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:8000`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:8000/ws/session/mobile-demo`

## 2) Install and run

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start --tunnel
```

`expo start --tunnel` prints a QR code in terminal. Scan it with Expo Go.

## 3) Backend

Run FastAPI backend in another terminal:

```bash
cd ../backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Use `--host 0.0.0.0` so phone can reach the API.
